Following along [Wes Bos' JavaScript30 Vanilla JS Challenge](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30). Check it out, it's awesome.

Solutions with comments are in `START` files; `FINISHED` are kept as a reminder. `notes.md` contain my notes too, but it's updated less frequently. I hope it will also evolve into a blog post or two! :smile:

You can grab the course for yourselves at [https://JavaScript30.com](https://JavaScript30.com).
